PROS:
1. From the map, we would easily see the difference by the size of the circle.
2. One good thing in the information map  section, it displays with the two sided drag bar.

CONS:
1. On the College information map, I think the color bar should put on the top, people will usually drag the bar first. Or the color should be combined together with the each bar.
2. We should now the exactly each variable is, does  the SAT mean average score or not?
3. In the information summary section, the color of the visualization cannot see clearly, for example the orange, yellow one.
In the BEST VALUE UNIVERSITY section, the School Rank bar does not make the plot any difference.
4. Student information part is unused.
5. In the school recommendation part, the gpa bar and Sat writing are not showing any changes.
6. And the if you divided the SAT into different parts, it should also divide the ACT into separate part to score combination.
