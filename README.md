+ **Project summary**: Our project takes all available data on colleges and universities in New York State and attempts to create a useful shiny app that allows users to explore and compare schools based on user-specific filtering criteria. The purpose of our design is to provide users with a bird's eye view of New York colleges and universities; allow them to filter, search, and group schools by their preferred criteria; and further compare two schools on a more micro level. A distinguishing feature of our app is the map search function. Before we select any filter on the map, we can see all the schools on the map.
