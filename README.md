# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

## To do (2/11 Monday)

- [ ] [Fei Zheng](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spr2017-proj2-grp4)
- [ ] [Tianchen](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spr2017-proj2-grp10)
- [ ] [Yiwei Li](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spr2017-proj2-grp12)
- [ ] [Tianyi Li](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spr2017-proj2-grp13)
- [ ] [HyunBin Yoo](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Spr2017-proj2-grp15)


- [ ] Aim to write a project plan by 2/13.
- [ ] Week 1 is the studying & planning week. Study previous apps assigned to you, read project description, data description, browse data and brainstorm for ideas.
- [ ] Think of how we are going to improve the app. As a team, study the assigned apps together (not necessarily face-to-face). During the discussion, discuss a number of key analyses/functionalities carefully and discuss possible improvements.

>
> "What information is of value or interesting?"
>
> Good visualizations do not just look cool. They should be easy to understand and give the correct impression about data.
