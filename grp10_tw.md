Project about how to select university based on their academic performance, average cost of attendance, earnings and jobs, safety and life quality.

### Pros:
- 1. Good topic in some senses.
- 2. Website has some nice color, make it more interesting to read
- 3. Clear structure in shiny web 

### Cons:
- 1. The website is relatively slow.
- 2. Need to click on “submit” first to apply filtering condition and then click on “search”
- 3. Unable to adapt to the browser size automatically
- 4. Unbalanced page layout, the left side of website contains so many information and can’t be shown in the same page as right side.
- 5. Lack of clear instructions on how to use the app
- 6. Unclear scaler of slide bars to choose our “value”
- 7. Bug, if you first click on “search” button and then change some variables among those slide bars and then click on “submit”, it will return one result “AI Miami International University of Art and Design”.
- 9. Useless overview banner, and it is better to reorder the buttons on the left side.
